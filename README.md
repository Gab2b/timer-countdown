# Timer Countdown

Timer Countdown is (or will may be) a gnome shell extension that displays the remaining time until a date you will choose yourself ;)
With this extension, you can easily keep track of the time left until an exam day, a travel  or much more other events !

The countdown is displayed in the panel, so it doesn't take up space on your desktop and is always easily accessible.

This repo is highly inspired by the [deadline-timer](https://github.com/patwork/deadline-timer) of patwork and its actually a fork of YKS Timer.
You can go check it [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5910/yks-timer/) and [there](https://github.com/ysfsvm/yks-timer) !
